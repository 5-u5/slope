/*  Attach this script to an object with a mesh,
    and it will generate game objects at each vertex upon running the game.
    Move the objects generated at each vertex, and this script will update the mesh according to your positions.
    Note that this does not include logic to move each vertex object in the game window,
    they must be moved in the editor window while running the game.
    Note that this script does not handle saving the modified mesh after ending the game.
    For vertex objects to appear in correct positions, the original mesh transform must have (1,1,1) scaling, and (0,0,0) rotation and position.
    Else, the vertex objects will appear offset, but still have the same function when moved.
